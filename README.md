# V Documentation Generator

NOTE: the commits on this repo's main branch are done automatically,
each time the main V repo's `master` branch is updated.

This repo is responsible for the content on https://docs.vlang.io/ .
Its content is generated by a custom V program, that is available in
the <https://github.com/vlang/docs/tree/generator> branch.

The information from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlang/v/master/doc/docs.md
is split into pages, and each page is formatted to a separate .html
file, for the convenience of the viewers.

To change the generator code, do: 
`git clone --branch generator https://github.com/vlang/docs docs_generator/`
then follow the instructions in its
[README.md](https://github.com/vlang/docs/blob/generator/README.md) file.

## External dependencies
You'll need [V](https://github.com/vlang/v?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-v-from-source),
and [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/) .
